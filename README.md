# rotate_backup
Simple python script for clean backup based on backup ages.
It is more like a demonstration to use python sets for manage backupsets.

# testing
    ./test.sh
It will create a bunch of 0 byte long tar.gz archives with different ages in the data folder.

# Run the cleanup
    ./rotate_backup.py
